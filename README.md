# Libraries Used

* [Architecture][10] - Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data
  persistence.
  * [lifecycle][22] - As a user navigates through, out of, and back to your app, the Activity instances in your app transition through different states in their lifecycle.
  * [Repository][18] - Repository modules handle data operations.
  * [ViewModel][17] - Easily schedule asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
  * [View Binding][11] - a feature that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
  * [Navigation][50] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation.
     asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
  * [livedata][52] - is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.


* [UI][30] - Details on why and how to use UI Components in your apps - together or separate
  * [Fragment][34] - A basic unit of composable UI.
  * [Layout][35] - Lay out widgets using different algorithms.
